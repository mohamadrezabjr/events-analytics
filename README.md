# ðŸ“Š EventsAnalytics API

## ðŸš€ Introduction

**EventsAnalytics** is a **Django REST Framework**-based API designed for tracking, managing, and analyzing user events.
It allows storing detailed event data and retrieving aggregated analytics reports efficiently, even under high request volumes.

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies

* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)
* [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* [Docker & Docker Compose](https://www.docker.com/)
* [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/) for asynchronous event processing
* Redis (used internally by Celery and caching layer)

---

## ðŸ“¦ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohamadrezabjr/events-analytics.git
cd events-analytics
```

### 2. Build and run Docker containers

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### 3. Apply migrations (inside the web container)

```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
```

### 4. Create a superuser (optional)

```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## âš¡ Background Processing with Celery

To handle high volumes of events efficiently, **EventsAnalytics** uses **Celery** for asynchronous event processing.

* Incoming event requests are queued and processed in the background.
* Reduces response time for API clients.
* Fully integrated into Docker Compose; no additional setup required.

> All `Create Event` requests are processed asynchronously, keeping endpoints fast and responsive.

---

## ðŸ—„ Caching

**Request-level caching** improves performance and reduces backend load:

* All requests (GET or POST) are cached along with their request body.
* Responses are stored so repeated requests can be served immediately without reprocessing.
* **Maximum cache size** is defined in `analytics/tasks.py`.
* When exceeding this size, **least frequently used (LFU)** entries are automatically removed.
* Integrated with Docker Compose; no additional setup required.

> High-frequency requests are handled efficiently while keeping cache size under control.
